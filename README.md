This repository contains the **code** and instructions to reproduce the experiments of CAEVL, a data-efficient UAV geolocalization method trained without paired UAV–satellite images. Our method leverages **edge-based representations** and **non-contrastive learning** to achieve competitive performance while being lightweight and generalizable.
